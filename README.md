# Knights Bearers of the Cross of Forez: Lineage, Crusades and a little known village in Bulgaria

## Preface

"*Kondofrey* (*Кондофрей*)"! What a weird name! I still remember passing through this village when I was a kid, each time we paid a visit to my great grandmother in the next village. If you don't speak Bulgarian, it might not be that obvious, but to a native speaker, there can't be any doubt about the foreign nature of the name. Then, much later in life, when I was already speaking French, my mother, who was also fluent, told me that there was a local legend about a crusader knight, named Count of Frey - *Comte de Frey* - who was the actual founder of the village.

30 years later, and with a keen interest in the history of the Crusades, and in the middle of a huge judicial scandal, with lots of spare time on my hands, I remembered that story and set on a journey to try to match it to French history. Someone who had a count level title was simply bound to have left a written trace - especially a knight during the Crusades. My first naive attempt turned out to be a dead end - Fray or Frey was a very popular name in Northern France and Belgium - but it was a commoner name and there was no way a count was ever named de Fray or de Frey as no such county ever existed.

To my great surprise, there were already two scientific papers by serious researchers in peer-reviewed journals discussing the local legend and the eventual origin of the name. Thomas Tomov had already done most of the ground-breaking work - including exhausting the very limited Bulgarian sources. As it was obvious that the name was transmitted orally - and was probably deformed - he had compiled an exhaustive list of all crusader knights whose name sounded vaguely similar - then he had proceeded to eliminate every single one of them.

I went rapidly through his list - Friaize, Flandre, ... Forez. Forez! *Comte de Forez*! As a native speaker of Bulgarian who had lived for most of his adult life in France, the similarity of the pronunciation to the Bulgarian Kondofre was striking. In fact, a Bulgarian, unfamiliar with the French mute E sound, simply couldn't pronounce it better than this.

Alas, given it was impossible to match him - part of the Fourth Crusade - or his son - part of the Barons Crusade - to the legend given their biographies.

Still, unable to believe this similarity to be a simple coincidence, I started researching it and rapidly found a number of discrepancies in all modern sources. A second-level commander of a lesser known Crusade - the Barons Crusade - no researcher had ever studied him in detail. There was also confusion in most sources about the numbering scheme used.

Trying to clarify it led to my first discovery - in fact, the Forez from the Fourth Crusade and the Barons Crusade were not father and son - but rather father, son and a great-son - three successive generations took part in those two Crusades, with the great-son taking part in two different crusades - the Barons Crusade and the Seventh Crusade. This was the actual source of confusion - and not a difference between the Anglo-Saxon and the French numbering style.

This paper tries to establish the following new facts:

* That during the Barons Crusade, there was an unexpected change of command, as Count Guigues IV died while traveling and was replaced - in-extremis - by his son Count Guigues of Forez. There is very compelling evidence for this fact.

* That the Count of Forez, whether it was Guigues IV or Guigues V, was the actual eponym of the village of Kondofrey. Alas, the evidence for this remains very inconclusive and largely circumstantial. Still, the Count of Forez is to be considered a very strong candidate.

## The Crusading Family of Forez

The counts of Forez were one of the most active crusading families of the Middle Ages. In fact, after the counties of Forez and Nevers were merged in 1226, the new combined family had sent a family member to every single major crusade in the Holy Lands - very often the title-bearer himself.

In this paper, we will focus on the three (and not two) most famous knights, and we will try to settle a number of problems and cases of mistaken identity between them. Traditionally these have been attributes to problems with the numbering scheme, but it seems that most of the confusion is due to the change of command during the Barons Crusade - a fact that it not mentioned in any modern sources - including the very exhaustive *The Barons' Crusade : a call to arms and its consequences / Michael Lower - 2005 [1]*.

This is the first study of the Forez family since the chronicles of Jean-Marie de la Mure in 1675 and uses a number of documents that were not available to him - especially the the *Rothelin continuation of the History of William of Tyre* written at the end of the 13th century in the Holy Lands - which were not brought back to Europe until much later.

### Count Guigues (Guy) III of Forez

1152 - 1203

Count Guy III of Forez was one of the leaders of the Fourth Crusade. He left in 1202 and reached Acre in Palestine. He died of illness during a military campaign near Jerusalem and his remains were transported back to Acre. There is little doubt about the circumstances of his death and his place of burial is well known - in the church "The Knights of Saint-John of Jerusalem".

Jean-Marie de la Mure cites November 28 1202 as date of his death ([4], page 186) and this is the date inscribed in the church of Montbrison built by his son. However most crusader sources cite 1203 or 1204 as the year of his death. 1203 would be the most probable year, given the military campaigns during the Fourth Crusade and the outbreak of plague that followed.

### Count Guigues (Guy) IV of Forez

1196 or 1199 - 1240 or 1241

#### Early life

Count Guy IV was still a young child when his father set on the Fourth Crusade. His regent and tutor was his uncle, Renaud de Forez, archbishop of Lyon and younger brother of his father Guy III. According to de la Mure, he tutored him from 1205 to 1212 ([4], pages 203-204). However, in additional documents uncovered for the 1860 edition of the chronicles, indicate that he may have become of full legal age as late as 1217. This is the only direct source attesting his birth year - which must be either 1196 or 1199 ([#4], pages 203-204)

It is his uncle who incited him to build the church Notre-Dame-d'Espérance in Montbrison and to make Montbrison the capital of the Forez county ([4], page 205).

#### First marriage in 1216

He is briefly engaged to one of Count Guy II of Auvergne's daughters, but the wedding does not take place as some of their peers oppose this new alliance ([4], page 204). His first marriage is to Philippie de Dampierre, daughter of Guy de Dampierre, Lord of Bourbon. The marriage is short-lived, as she dies soon after without producing any children ([4], page 208).

#### Second marriage in 1220

His second marriage is to Ermengarde (Arméniarde) d'Auvergne, daughter of Count Guy II of Auvergne. It is not clear if this is the same daughter as his initial engagement. This marriage produces two potential successors: Guigues (Guy) and Renaud ([4], page 211).

#### Commissions the church of Montbrison

The construction of the church - major landmark of this town - starts in 1223 ([4], page 212).

#### Third marriage in 1226

His third marriage is to Princess Mahault of Courtenay, countess of Nevers. This marriage does not produce any children, and it is mostly political, as it allows to merge the two counties - Forez and Nevers - creating a very large feudal domain - and making Guy IV one of the most important French counts.

#### Feudal wars of 1230s

He takes part in a number of small feudal conflicts during the 1230s against his neighbors - including Prince Thibault 4 of Champagne - the future leader of the Barons Crusade. Previously, they had been close allies. He is considered an accomplished military commander.

#### The Barons Crusade and Death

He takes part in the organization of the Barons Crusade and it is eager to follow the steps of his father who he barely knew. However there might have been other, more Earthly reasons for his decision. As was the case for many crusader knights, the privileges of the special legal status that they enjoyed also played a major role. Some sources mention a possible - and very serious - sentence of excommunication for harboring heretics ([2], page 726, [3], page 416, to check!!!). Other sources cite large debts, for which a crusader did not have to pay interest ([#3], page 546). The debt theory is further corroborated by administrative acts mentioned by de la Mure ([#4], page 246). There are however no traces of any sentence of excommunication in the original sources.

According to Jean-Marie de la Mure, he dies on August 12 1239. In his chronicles from 1675, de la Mure asserts that Guy IV never had the chance to depart on the Crusade, as he died shortly before its departure. On the other side, in the 1860 revised edition of his manuscript, this most likely wrong statement is attributed to an administrative act - the execution of his will - dated May 8 1240.

The presence of another will, dated August 12 1241 - the same date, but two years later - suggests that his is simply an error. August 12 1241 is also the date inscribed on his tomb in the Montbrison church. The authors of the 1860 edition also cite a number of administrative acts from another archive - "Trésor des Chartes du Roi" - which contain a number of financial transactions made by his wife - and which indicate that he was absent during this period. The first mention of his death is in 1241 and the first administrative acts of Guy V are from 1242. ([4], pages 239-241).

All this means that he likely did depart on the Barons Crusade - and the decision to replace him with his son was taken after the main crusader force had left.

This theory is also confirmed by another independent source - the Eracles chronicles written in the Holy Lands. Book 33, chapter 44 mentions that a new great crusade had departed from France and was awaited in the Holy Land and proceeds to enumerate the knights taking part: *"The count of Forez who was count of Nevers in right of his wife"*. [#5]. Janet Shirley identifies this count as Guigues V, count of Forez (1203-1241) and Nevers (1239-1241) - and this is clearly Guigues IV according to this paper's numbering.

Thus we conclude that Guigues IV did leave on the Barons Crusade.

### Guigues V, Count of Forez and Nevers

1220-1222 - 1259

Guigues V was groomed for a military commander by his father. He accompanied his father during his campaigns in France "as soon as his age allowed him to bear arms" ([#4], page, 244). Still, he must have been about 10 to 12 years old during this campaign and it is unlikely to have had significant combat experience before the Barons Crusade.

According to Jean-Marie de la Mure, he leaves after the main crusader force had already departed - and **finds the Christian army in very bad shape** [#4, page 245] - this statement is highly indicative of an actual change of command ***during*** the Crusade.

The other corroborating evidence for such change of command is that in the Holy Lands, he is referred as Count Guy of Nevers (citation needed!!!).

While Count Guy IV of Forez was also Count of Nevers - by right of his third marriage - he was not the title holder. It is very unlikely that he would have styled himself Guy of Nevers - nobles would usually choose their most important title to be part of their name. However, it was his wife who was the actual title holder. On the other side, Guy V had inherited both titles and it is likely he styled himself Guy of Nevers - as Nevers was the larger county. This is the other evidence that the Guy in the Holy Lands was not the same Guy as the one who had departed from France.

#### Illness in Apulia

According to Jean-Marie de la Mure, the one to fall sick in Apulia is Guy V and not Guy IV - and he does die from it, he returns in Europe alive. Still, while sick, he writes his will - this the will from 1241 that is subject to much controversy when it comes to its author - Guy IV or Guy V. However according to the 1860 edition, this will is actually written by Guy IV ([#4], page 245).

Most modern sources cite this illness as the cause of death of Guy IV.

#### Return to Europe

Guy V returns to Europe in 1242 ([#4], page 246).

#### Seventh Crusade

He returns to the Holy Land in 1248, joining the Seventh Crusade led by the French King Louis IX. He travels alone in 1250 and join Louis in Palestine, unable to depart with the main crusader force in 1248 ([#4], page 247-248).

#### Maimed

He loses a leg during a battle in the Holy Land in 1250 and has to return to Europe ([#4], page 250)

#### Death

He dies without issue in 1251 and he is succeeded by his brother, Renaud I de Forez ([#4], page 254)

## The Barons Crusade

The Barons Crusade is a relatively lesser known crusade that is considered to be a failure by most scholars. Militarily, it was very well prepared and consisted of a very sizeable and capable armed force. However because of various organizational problems, it failed to achieve any goals. It is studied very extensively by Lower in his 2005 book.

It consists of two separate and largely independent military campaigns - one to the Holy Lands and another one to the Latin Empire in Constantinople. The diversion to Constantinople was largely the brainchild of Pope Gregory IX and it was a follow-up to the very controversial Fourth Crusade which ended with the sacking of Constantinople in 1205. Pope Gregory IX continued with the policy of trying to reunite Christianity - by defeating the Orthodox Christians on the battlefield and imposing a Catholic Patriarch. It was him the driving force for diverting funds from the Holy Lands and trying to coerce the various European knights to switch their vows from Jerusalem to Constantinople.

Thus, both armies shared the same funding and left about the same time. Both of them had to travel by sea from Italy, since the Holy Roman Empire and its emperor, Frederick II, were very hostile to the idea of the Pope gaining control of Constantinople, as they saw themselves as the true holders of the Roman Empire legacy.

### The Diversion to Constantinople

Both military campaigns were not very successful. The campaign to Constantinople crossed the Adriatic. Historic sources (citations?) record Tzar Ivan Asen II meeting the crusaders at the western border of Bulgaria. At this moment Ivan Asen II was allied to Ioan Vatatzes of Nicaea against the Latin Empire. His predecessor - Tzar Kaloyan had successfully defeated the crusaders 35 years earlier. It is still unclear how the crusaders and Tzar Ivan Asen II reached an agreement. Bulgarian sources (citation?) speculate that Tzar Ivan Asen II did not wish to fight fellow Christians en route to the Holy Land. Crusader sources (citation?) indicate that the crusaders definitely considered the option of meeting the combined Bulgarian and Greek armies on the battlefield - but quickly realized that they were hopelessly outnumbered. Finally, Tzar Ivan Asen II made one of the most significant contributions the Barons Crusade - a squadron of Cuman light cavalry for which the Bulgarians were famous - thus turning his back on the Greeks. It seems that the alliance between the Bulgarians and the Greeks against the Latin Empire was a very precarious one, since both sides coveted Constantinople. Although the subject is interesting, it is beyond the scope of the current paper.

## The village of Kondofrey

The local legend is already very well studied by Thomas Tomov ([#6]) and it is unlikely that there will ever be more information about it.

The village appeared in historical records for the first time in the 13th century - so if it was indeed linked to a crusade - it must have been the Fourth Crusade, the Barons Crusade or the the Seventh Crusade. Its name during this time was Kondofre.

*...phonetic analysis.. to write... basically not pronouncing a French mute E, the phonetic match is perfect*

A Count of Forez took part in all of these crusades: Guy III during the Fourth Crusade, both Guy IV and Guy V - according to this new theory - during the Barons Crusade and only Guy V during the Seventh Crusade.

The only one to have died from illness while traveling was Guy IV. Guy III died next to Jerusalem and it is buried in the church in Acre. Guy V returned to France where he is buried. Guy IV's coffin was famously carried (still left to check the church records in Montbrison!!!) from Italy, which makes him a very probable candidate.

### In which military campaign did Guy IV take part?

Count Guy IV of Forez was probably the most influential count among the leaders of the crusade - and his army was second only to that of the princes themselves. Thus he can be considered to have been the 4th most senior leader of the Crusade.

Tensions among the leaders of the Barons Crusade were very high. Many of the knights had been at war just a few years earlier - because of the failed attempt of Thibault IV to seize the throne of France from Louis. They quickly formed three factions, led by each of the princes and the three armies marched separately and never fought as a single unit [#1, page 51].

In which military campaign did Guy IV take part?

Modern sources are unanimous - he was part of Thibault IV's force. However this assumption - no matter how logical - is not confirmed by any original historical source. Guy IV and Thibault IV used to be close allies, but had a falling out in 1235, just a few years before the crusade, when they went to war over a land dispute. Guy V, still a child, was also present at the battlefield. It is also known that Gregory IX tried to pressure Thibault IV to be part of the Constantinople diversion. Thibault IV was in difficult position because of his failed attempt to seize the French crown. Still he preferred to go to the Holy Land - and this is very well documented.

### Possible theories

From this point on, only speculation is possible. Is it possible that Guy's army decided to take a different route? It is possible that they had to wait somewhere for his son to arrive? Is is possible that they went through Bulgaria with the other crusader force?

The chronicles of Jean-Marie de la Mure are quite detailed when it comes to the lives of the Forez family in France - however they contain nothing about their military campaigns far from home. The only historical sources documenting what happened in the East were not available to him. Likely, the knights themselves told their story - but these stories were not written.

No one chronicled the Constantinople diversion (Greek sources?? to check??). In only one century both the Bulgarian and the Greek kingdoms were going to be no more - destroyed by the invasion of the Ottomans - with most of their archives gone.

This means that if we try to reason the other way around - if Guy IV de Forez was indeed in Bulgaria, would there be any sources that could say the contrary - the answer would still be negative (more research!!!).

In any case, if Kondofre was indeed named after Count de Forez, it would likely been far more official than a simple case of the locals paying homage to a great foreign knight and military commander. It was much more likely an official royal charter by the Bulgarian Tzar himself to an important military ally - one that was maybe too sick to continue his journey.

# Conclusion

Although this paper fails to establish a definite link between the name of the village of Kondofrey and the Count of Forez, it definitely establishes him as another very strong potential candidate.

It also clarifies the existing confusion about the numbering scheme for Counts of Forez - and for this there is very compelling evidence.
