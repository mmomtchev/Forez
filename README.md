# Knights Bearers of the Cross of Forez: Lineage, Crusades and a little known village in Bulgaria

## Preface

"*Kondofrey* (*Кондофрей*)"! What a weird name! I still remember passing through this village when I was a kid, each time we paid a visit to my great grandmother in the next village. If you don't speak Bulgarian, it might not be that obvious, but to a native speaker, there can't be any doubt about the foreign nature of the name. Then, much later in life, when I was already speaking French, my mother, who was also fluent, told me that there was a local legend about a crusader knight, named Count of Frey - *Comte de Frey* - who was the actual founder of the village.

30 years later, and with a keen interest in the history of the Crusades, and in the middle of a huge judicial scandal, with lots of spare time on my hands, I remembered that story and set on a journey to try to match it to French history. Someone who had a count level title was simply bound to have left a written trace - especially a knight during the Crusades. My first naive attempt turned out to be a dead end - Fray or Frey was a very popular name in Northern France and Belgium - but it was a commoner name and there was no way a count was ever named de Fray or de Frey as no such county ever existed.

To my great surprise, there were already two scientific papers by serious researchers in peer-reviewed journals discussing the local legend and the eventual origin of the name. Thomas Tomov had already done most of the ground-breaking work - including exhausting the very limited Bulgarian sources. As it was obvious that the name was transmitted orally - and was probably deformed - he had compiled an exhaustive list of all crusader knights whose name sounded vaguely similar - then he had proceeded to eliminate every single one of them.

I went rapidly through his list - Friaize, Flandre, ... Forez. Forez! *Comte of Forez*! As a native speaker of Bulgarian who had lived for most of his adult life in France, the similarity of the pronunciation to the Bulgarian Kondofre was striking. In fact, a Bulgarian, unfamiliar with the French mute E sound, simply couldn't pronounce it better than this.

Alas, given it was impossible to match him - part of the Fourth Crusade - or his son - part of the Barons Crusade - to the legend given their biographies.

Still, unable to believe this similarity to be a simple coincidence, I started researching it and rapidly found a number of discrepancies in all modern sources. A second-level commander of a lesser known Crusade - the Barons Crusade - no researcher had ever studied him in detail. There was also confusion in most sources about the numbering scheme used.

Trying to clarify it led to my first discovery - in fact, the Forez from the Fourth Crusade and the Barons Crusade were not father and son - but rather father, son and a great-son - three successive generations took part in those two Crusades, with the great-son taking part in two different crusades - the Barons Crusade and the Seventh Crusade. This was the actual source of confusion - and not a difference between the Anglo-Saxon and the French numbering style.

This paper has two main goals:

* Completely rebuild the genealogy of the Forez family during the period of the Crusades entirely from primary sources and serve as a definite reference on this subject.

  Scarce primary data, at least three different numbering schemes and years of cross-citing have led to extreme confusion in all modern sources.

  This paper uses Jean-Marie de la Mure work as a framework. As a priest with access to the church records in the very church the Forez family built during this period, he is likely to be the best source when it comes to their births, marriages and deaths. Then overlay all the Eastern primary sources onto this framework trying to match each record to a family member.

* Use this data to try to link one the crusading knights to the village of Kondodrey.

## The Crusading Family of Forez

The counts of Forez were one of the most active crusading families of the Middle Ages. They took part in the First Crusade, the Fourth Crusade, the Barons Crusade and the Seventh Crusade.

In this paper, we will focus on the three (and not two) most famous knights, and we will try to settle a number of problems and cases of mistaken identity between them. Traditionally these have been attributes to problems with the numbering scheme, but it seems that most of the confusion is due to the change of command during the Barons Crusade - a fact that it not mentioned in any modern sources - including the very exhaustive *The Barons' Crusade : a call to arms and its consequences / Michael Lower - 2005 [1]*.

This is the first study of the Forez family since the chronicles of Jean-Marie de la Mure in 1675 and uses a number of documents that were not available to him - especially the the *Rothelin continuation of the History of William of Tyre* written at the end of the 13th century in the Holy Lands - which were not brought back to Europe until much later.

### Count Guigues (Guy) III of Forez

1152 - 1203

Count Guy III of Forez was one of the leaders of the Fourth Crusade. He left in 1202 and reached Acre in Palestine. He died of illness during a military campaign near Jerusalem and his remains were transported back to Acre. There is little doubt about the circumstances of his death and his place of burial is well known - in the church "The Knights of Saint-John of Jerusalem".

Jean-Marie de la Mure cites November 28 1202 as date of his death ([4], page 186) and this is the date inscribed in the church of Montbrison built by his son. However most crusader sources cite 1203 or 1204 as the year of his death ([#2], page 5). 1203 would be the most probable year, given the military campaigns during the Fourth Crusade and the outbreak of plague that followed.

A very notable fact is that Guy III is referred as "Guillaume, Count of Nevers" in [#2], page 5 - a title he definitely did not hold as this title came in possession of the Forez family following the 1226 marriage of his son, Guy IV.

Three explanations for this confusion are possible:
* The confusion is due to Guy IV of Forez - who seem to be the most notable one - was also count of Nevers - and these chronicles were actually written after the fact
* An earlier count of Nevers, William IV of Nevers, died of fever in Jerusalem in 1167 ([#8], page 66), the statement can be traced back to Chronicon Turonense
* A later of count of Nevers, Eude (Odo) of Nevers, also died in Acre - in 1265 or 1266 ([#2], page 176)

Besides Guy IV of Forez and Nevers, there has been only one other Guy of Nevers and he never reached the Holy Land ([#8], page 66).

Thus, the first explanation is accepted as the most probable one. *Les gestes des Chiprois* is considered to have been written between 1314 and 1321 and is attributed Gérard of Montréal. As the most notable Forez knight was count of both Nevers and Forez, which were a single feudal domain during his time, the mistake can be explained. 

### Count Guigues (Guy) IV of Forez and Nevers (after 1226)

1196 or 1199 - 1240 or 1241

#### Early life

Count Guy IV was still a young child when his father set on the Fourth Crusade. His regent and tutor was his uncle, Renaud of Forez, archbishop of Lyon and younger brother of his father Guy III. According to de la Mure, he tutored him from 1205 to 1212 ([4], pages 203-204). However, in additional documents uncovered for the 1860 edition of the chronicles, indicate that he may have become of full legal age as late as 1217. This is the only direct source attesting his birth year - which must be either 1196 or 1199 ([#4], pages 203-204).

It is his uncle who incited him to build the church Notre-Dame-d'Espérance in Montbrison and to make Montbrison the capital of the Forez county ([4], page 205).

#### First marriage in 1216

He is briefly engaged to one of Count Guy II of Auvergne's daughters, but the wedding does not take place as some of their peers oppose this new alliance ([4], page 204). His first marriage is to Philippie de Dampierre, daughter of Guy de Dampierre, Lord of Bourbon. The marriage is short-lived, as she dies soon after without producing any children ([4], page 208).

#### Second marriage in 1220

His second marriage is to Ermengarde (Arméniarde) d'Auvergne, daughter of Count Guy II of Auvergne. It is not clear if this is the same daughter as his initial engagement. This marriage produces two potential successors: Guigues (Guy) and Renaud ([4], page 211).

#### Commissions the church of Montbrison

The construction of the church - major landmark of this town - starts in 1223 ([4], page 212).

#### Third marriage in 1226

His third marriage is to Princess Mahault (Matilda) of Courtenay, countess of Nevers. Princess Mahault is 38 years old and this marriage produces one daughter. It is mostly political, as it allows to merge the two counties - Forez and Nevers - creating a very large feudal domain - and making Guy IV one of the most prominent French counts.

According to [#11], page 141, Guy IV of Forez would sometimes sign acts as Guy of Nevers (*try to find a more accurate, peer-reviewed reference for this fact than #11*).

#### Personality

The only account of the personality of Guy IV that has reached us comes from the King Louis himself ([#11], page 133 *try to find the original source*). It was the King who arranged the marriage between Guy IV and Princess Mahault - because he considered that his blunt and direct personality would make a perfect match for the strong-willed Mahault who had a reputation for being a difficult wife. Mahault, a remarkable woman and a very significant character of her era, was one of the very few women who had taken part in a crusade herself - she had been in the Holy Land as part of the Fifth Crusade. The blessing of the King was very important, since this marriage between two powerful nobles had significant implications for the power status-quo in France, creating a new very powerful count. This description of Guy IV's personality is consistent with that of a military commander and not a court player or a diplomat.

#### Feudal wars of 1229

He takes part in a number of small feudal conflicts during the 1229 against his neighbors - including Prince Thibault IV of Champagne - the future leader of the Barons Crusade. Previously, they had been close allies. He is considered an accomplished military commander.

#### The Barons Crusade

He takes part in the organization of the Barons Crusade and it is eager to follow the steps of his father who he barely knew. However there might have been other, more Earthly reasons for his decision. As was the case for many crusader knights, the privileges of the special legal status that they enjoyed also played a major role. Some sources mention a possible - and very serious - sentence of excommunication for harboring heretics ([2], page 726, [3], page 416, to check!!!). Other sources cite large debts, for which a crusader did not have to pay interest ([#3], page 546). The debt theory is further corroborated by administrative acts mentioned by de la Mure ([#4], page 246). There are however no traces of any sentence of excommunication in the original sources.

#### Death according to de la Mure

According to Jean-Marie de la Mure, he dies on August 12 1239. In his chronicles from 1675, de la Mure asserts that Guy IV never had the chance to depart on the Crusade, as he died shortly before its departure. On the other side, in the 1860 revised edition of his manuscript, this most likely wrong statement is attributed to an administrative act - the execution of his will - dated May 8 1240.

The presence of another will, dated August 12 1241 - the same date, but two years later - suggests that his is simply an error. August 12 1241 is also the date inscribed on his tomb in the Montbrison church. The authors of the 1860 edition also cite a number of administrative acts from another archive - "Trésor des Chartes du Roi" - which contain a number of financial transactions made by his wife - and which indicate that Guy IV was absent during this period. The first mention of his death is in 1241 and the first administrative acts of Guy V are from 1242. ([4], pages 239-241).

All this means that Guy IV did depart on the Barons Crusade and died on its way back.

This theory is also confirmed by another independent source - the Eracles chronicles. Book 33, chapter 44 mentions that a new great crusade had departed from France and was awaited in the Holy Land and proceeds to enumerate the knights taking part: *"The count of Forez who was count of Nevers in right of his wife"*. [#5]. Janet Shirley identifies this count as Guigues V, count of Forez (1203-1241) and Nevers (1239-1241) - and this is clearly Guigues IV according to this paper's numbering.

It is very likely that de la Mure concluded himself that Guigues never left on the crusade according to the erroneous year of death - 1239. He must have proceeded to write an account, which currently seems to be completely fictitious, of his son, Guigues V, joining the crusade at a later date (see the detailed discussion below).

#### Departing from France

He is mentioned as "Guigues V, count of Forez and Nevers" traveling from Lyon to Marseille - the port of departure for the crusade in ([#10], page 312). The group of crusaders led by Thibault IV met in Lyon and traveled together to Marseille where they met with the rest of the French knights. This work, very similar to the one by de la Mure, is written at a much later date during the 19th century, with the author having access to the Eracles chronicles. There is one critical detail: Thibault IV left from Champagne in June 1239 and the group arrived in Marseille in August 1239. This is right before the earliest possible date of death of Guy IV - and one which is widely discounted as being a mistake ([#4], page 240). Thus, we conclude, that this statement might have been influenced by the erroneous theory of de la Mure that Guy V took part in this crusade.

Another fact supporting this theory in [#10], which describes the feudal conflicts of 1229 in great detail - which pitted Guy IV against Thibault IV - Guy IV is sometimes referred as the Count of Nevers. Nevers played an important role in those conflicts - as the marriage of 1226 made that it was not considered anymore part of Champagne ([#10], page 252). The only Forez that was also count of Nevers is Guy IV.

In [#2], page 118, there is also a list of the departing knights from Marseille that mentions "..., the count of Forez, the count of Nevers, ..." without a name and listing these as if they were two different persons:

> ...que l'en clamoit Piere Mauclerc, li cuens de Bretaigne, Johans de Dreues, cuens de Mascon, li cuens de Foroys, li cuens de Nevers, Henris, li cuens de Bar le duc, Amaury, li cuens de Monfort & autres plusors riches homes, des quels li cuens de Bar...

The author of the 1887 edition identifies him as Guy V - which should also be attributed to de la Mure's influence. Although one may be tempted to try to interpret this mistake as a sign that both Guy IV and Guy V might have been traveling together, this is not very likely, since Guy V could not have been referred as Count of Forez until the death of his father. As these two counts are the only ones that are not explicitly named, this is indicative of the author not really knowing their identities.

Also, according to [#11], page 163, Guy of Forez point of departure for the crusade was Nevers and he was accompanied by the bishop of Nevers.

#### In the Holy Land

In book 33, chapter 44, Eracles mentions the count of **Nevers** as being in Jaffa with the Knights Templar in 1240 ([#3], page 127), [#9], page 481 which cites [#10], page 315-316 as source, leads back to Eracles.

[#2], page 122 also includes an identical mention, naming him simply the Count of Nevers. (*what is the relation between the Rothelin manuscript and Gestes Chyprois? Is copying possible?*).

All of these sources confirm the expected conflict between Guy of Forez and Thibault IV de Champagne. At this point of the campaign the command authority of Thibault IV must be significantly eroded and Guy of Forez is refusing to follow orders and the two cannot agree on a common defense plan. He and the Knights Templar sign a separate truce with the Saracens and stay in Jaffa, while Thibault IV de Champagne and the Knights Hospitaliers decide to leave and try to defend Acre. The fact that the Templars are siding with Guy of Forez is indicative of serious lack of command authority by Thibault IV.

This can also be interpreted as another sign that this must be in fact the old Forez - Guy IV. It is difficult to imagine a 19-year old count successfully challenging the military command of a king. Thibault IV was selected as a military leader of the crusade because he was the only knight holding a king-level title ([#10], page 312) - being also king of Navarre. History remembers him as a great poet, but both his military campaigns ended in disaster. Still, challenging his leadership would have been possible only for a very experienced military commander.

[#11], page 166 contains an account of Guy of Forez being taken prisoner and then ransomed in 1240, which might be completely fictitious.

The departure of Thibault IV from Jaffa is dated September 1240 [Eracles, find it] - and this is the last mention of Guy IV in the Holy Land. It is also a further indication that the year of his death is 1241 and not 1240.

#### Guy of Acre

De la Mure mentions the adoption of a certain Guy of Acre, a damoiseau or a squire. Born in the Holy Land he traveled back to France with him. He is mentioned on two separate occasions - once during the Barons Crusade and once during the Seventh Crusade. This is a further indication for his confusion between Guy IV and Guy V ([#4], page 231 and page 250). The will of Guy IV mentions a certain Guillaume, but it is not clear of this is the same one (!!*reference*). De la Mure, in his account of the Barons Crsuade, that he misattrbutes to Guy V, mentions that immediately after his return from the Holy Land, Guy of Forez granted a domain to Alfonso of Brienne ([#4], page 246). Some scholars presume that this might be Guy of Acre (!!*who?*).

#### Recipient of a relic, piece of the True Cross from the Knights Templar

[#13], page 204 contains a mention of Guy IV receiving a piece of the True Cross and then passing it to his son. The source cited is the 1241 will.

The will contains indeed such a mention:

> ...
> Ranaldo filio meo, clerico, snaraldinum meliorem et veram crucem quam magister militie Templi dedit mihi.
> ...

 [#14], page 1241, 10 août

...
 *To Renaud, my son, [to join] the clergy, a very good emerald and the True Cross that the Master of the Temple militia gave me*
...

This confirms his previous will of 1239, just before setting on the crusade, that Renaud, his younger son, is destined to join the clergy.

Analyzing the authenticity of the relic is beyond the scope of this article, but it is certainly debatable. The relic that the Knights Templar called the *True Cross* is one of Christianity's most precious and most controversial relics. There are recorded occasions of the Knights Templar gifting splinters to very important crusaders - such as the one gifted to King Sigurd I of Norway in 1110 - all of these happened before the main relic was lost after the Battle of Hattin in 1187. Its whereabouts - or ultimate fate - are still unknown to this date. On the other side, it is entirely possible that the Templars preserved a number of splinters before its loss and that they held Guy of Forez in very high esteem. As the item can be traced back at least to the Knights Templar in Jaffa - and possibly - to the relic carried during the Battle of Montgisard, its authenticiy is definitely far above the average for splinters of the True Cross found throughout Western Europe.

The relic - and its current casing dating from the XIXth century is currently indexed as item IM42002138 in the General Catalogue of the Cultural Legacy of the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region in France [#15]. The official notice refers it as having been gifted to the Saint-Thomas convent by a certain Guy of Pressieu - after being brought during the Seventh Crusade by Guy IV of Forez. The source cited is de la Mure [#4] which we discount as being errenous.

#### Mention of Frederick II in his will

The will also contains a mention of Emperor Frederick II who may have been Guy's host:

> In primo legavi domino imperatori Alemannie unum diamantum quem multum diligebam et unum cinctorium argenti dearauti

*In the first place I bequeathed to the Emperor of Germany one diamond, which I loved very much, on a silver ring of gold*

The emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was at this time in Sicily. He was a sworn enemy to Pope Gregory IX who had him excommunicated on four different occasions despite the fact that he had been a crusader himself - during the Fifth Crusade.

#### Death

The currently accepted date for this will is August 12 1241. However the official mess marking his death is on October 29. It is not clear whether this is the actual date of his death or it is the date when his coffin reached back to Montbrison ([#14], page 1241, 10 août).

The original document from 1241 is not well preserved and some parts of it are missing. One can find a partial transcription in [#12], page 46 which indeed starts with:

> In nomine sancte et in[*dividue Trinitiatis, e*]go Guido comes Nivern[*ensis*] et Foren[*sis*]" 

(*extrapolated parts*)

As Guy IV of Forez is the only Forez who is also count of Nevers, this is clearly his will. The will also mentions being written Apulia with the town of Castellaneta being extrapolated from the missing text by the authors of the 1867 edition. The will is written on cotton paper which was widely used in Naples during this period ([#12], page 47).

According to #11, page 167, it is Princess Mahault who organizes the transport of his coffin from Italy.

### Guigues V, Count of Forez

1220-1222 - 1259

Guigues V was groomed for a military commander by his father. He accompanied his father during his campaigns in France "as soon as his age allowed him to bear arms" ([#4], page, 244). Still, he must have been about 13 to 14 years old during this campaign and it is unlikely to have had significant combat experience before the Barons Crusade.

The marriage between Guy IV and Ermengarde lasts from 1220 to 1224 and Guy V has a younger brother, which means that he is probably born either in 1221 or in 1222.

According to Jean-Marie de la Mure, he leaves after the main crusader force had already departed - and **finds the Christian army in very bad shape** [#4, page 245] - this statement is currently discounted as being completely fictitious.

He must be 18 to 20 years old at the time of his father death.

After the death of Guy IV of Forez, Princess Mahault of Courtenay retired from secular life and spent the rest of her days at the Fontevraud Abbey as a nun. She died there in 1257. She had a son, who died very young without marrying and a daughter from her first marriage - Agnes of Donzy - who died at the age of 24. She passed her title to Mahault of Borbon-Dampierre - her great grand-daughter ([#11], page 205). **Thus, the title Count of Nevers left the Forez family and the only Forez to ever hold it was Guy IV, by right of his marriage with his third wife.**

#### Illness in Apulia according to de la Mure

According to Jean-Marie de la Mure, the one to fall sick in Apulia is Guy V and not Guy IV - and he does die from it, he returns in Europe alive. Still, while sick, he writes his will - this the will from 1241 that is subject to much controversy when it comes to its author - Guy IV or Guy V. However according to the 1860 edition, this will is actually written by Guy IV ([#4], page 245).

According to de la Mure Guy V returns to Europe in 1242 ([#4], page 246).

Most modern sources cite this illness as the cause of death of Guy IV and we also conclude that this must be the case. Guy V never took part in this crusade and the illness in Apulia is the cause of death of Guy IV.

#### Seventh Crusade

According to de la Mure, he leaves for the Seventh Crusade in 1248 led by the French King Louis IX, but has to turn back in Marseille at stays in France until at least 1249 when he departs again ([#4], page 247-248). This is likely linked to the confusion about him taking part in the Barons Crusade. Once again, in his 1675 manuscript, de la Mure cites facts deduced from years and dates found on documents in the archives. According to the authors of the 1860 edition, some of these dates might be mistakes and it is possible that Guy V left with the main force led by the King.

#### Maimed

He loses a leg during a battle in the Holy Land in 1250 and has to return to Europe ([#4], page 250).

#### Marriage

After returning from the crusade, he is married to Alix of Chaceney in 1250 but this marriage does not produce any children.


#### Death

He dies without issue in 1251 and he is succeeded by his brother, Renaud I of Forez ([#4], page 254).

## The Barons Crusade

The Barons Crusade is a relatively lesser known crusade that is considered to be a failure by most scholars. Militarily, it was very well prepared and consisted of a very sizeable and capable armed force. However because of various organizational problems, it failed to achieve any goals. It is studied very extensively by Lower in his 2005 book.

It consists of two separate and largely independent military campaigns - one to the Holy Lands and another one to the Latin Empire in Constantinople. Both armies shared the same funding and left about the same time. The diversion to Constantinople was largely the brainchild of Pope Gregory IX and it was a follow-up to the very controversial Fourth Crusade which ended with the sacking of Constantinople in 1205. Pope Gregory IX continued with the policy of trying to reunite Christianity - by defeating the Orthodox Christians on the battlefield and imposing a Catholic Patriarch. It was him the driving force for diverting funds from the Holy Lands and trying to coerce the various European knights to switch their vows from Jerusalem to Constantinople.

Count Guy IV of Forez was probably the most influential count among the leaders of the crusade - and his army was second only to that of the princes themselves. Thus he can be considered to have been the 4th most senior leader of the Crusade.

Tensions among the leaders of the Barons Crusade were very high. Many of the knights had been at war just a few years earlier - because of the failed attempt of Thibault IV to seize the throne of France from Louis. They quickly formed three factions, led by each of the princes and the three armies marched separately and never fought as a single unit [#1, page 51].

The army to the Holy Land assembled in Marseille - a fact mentioned both by Eracles and [#7].

Guy IV of Forez traveled in Thibault IV's group, but tensions between them led to further fragmentation of the crusader force once in the Holy Land. They used to be close allies, but because Guy of Forez's marriage in 1226 and Thibault's rebellion against the king, they fought a brief war in 1229.

### The Diversion to Constantinople

Both military campaigns were not very successful. The campaign to Constantinople crossed the Adriatic. Historic sources (citations?) record Tzar Ivan Asen II meeting the crusaders at the western border of Bulgaria. At this moment Ivan Asen II was allied to Ioan Vatatzes of Nicaea against the Latin Empire. His predecessor - Tzar Kaloyan had successfully defeated the crusaders 35 years earlier. It is still unclear how the crusaders and Tzar Ivan Asen II reached an agreement. Bulgarian sources (citation?) speculate that Tzar Ivan Asen II did not wish to fight fellow Christians en route to the Holy Land. Crusader sources (citation?) indicate that the crusaders definitely considered the option of meeting the combined Bulgarian and Greek armies on the battlefield - but quickly realized that they were hopelessly outnumbered. Finally, Tzar Ivan Asen II made one of the most significant contributions the Barons Crusade - a squadron of Cuman light cavalry for which the Bulgarians were famous - thus turning his back on the Greeks. It seems that the alliance between the Bulgarians and the Greeks against the Latin Empire was a very precarious one, since both sides coveted Constantinople. Although the subject is interesting, it is beyond the scope of the current paper.

## Identity of the knight who left on the Barons Crusade

### Guy V (aka de la Mure's version)

It is very difficult to imagine de la Mure, priest in the church of Montbrison, built by Guy IV, being mistaken on the identity of the knight who went on a crusade - between Guy IV and his son Guy V.

Still, every other source is either influenced by him or states the contrary.

There seems to be a particularly enduring confusion, starting with him, between Guy IV and Guy V.

There are factual documents - from "Trésor des Chartes du Roi" - which dispute him claims of Guy IV dying right before the crusade. (*check if the originals can be examined*).

The fact that most crusader sources refer to Guy as a count of Forez and Nevers - or sometimes exclusively as count of Nevers - is particularly important as Guy V was never count of Nevers.

De la Mure's work was written about 400 years after the events of the Barons Crusade. The main source of his work was the church and the administrative records - which are currently part of the French national archives and - certainly - orally transmitted tales. There were no written records about what happened in the East that were available to him. This can explain the fact that otherwise real events that happened during the Seventh Crusade are misattrbuted to the Barons Crusade.

### Guy IV (most modern sources' version)

If one eliminates de la Mure's account of the Barons Crusade - as well as all other sources influenced by him - than the result is unanimous without any conflicts.

## The village of Kondofrey

The local legend is already very well studied by Thomas Tomov ([#6]) and it is unlikely that there will ever be more information about it.

The village appeared in historical records for the first time in the 13th century - so if it was indeed linked to a crusade - it must have been the Fourth Crusade, the Barons Crusade or the the Seventh Crusade. Its name during this time was Kondofre.

*...phonetic analysis.. to write... basically not pronouncing a French mute E, the phonetic match is perfect*

A Count of Forez took part in all of these crusades: Guy III during the Fourth Crusade, both Guy IV and Guy V - according to this new theory - during the Barons Crusade and only Guy V during the Seventh Crusade.

The only one to have died from illness while traveling was Guy IV. Guy III died next to Jerusalem and it is buried in the church in Acre. Guy V returned to France where he is buried. Guy IV's coffin was famously carried (still left to check the church records in Montbrison!!!) from Italy, which makes him a very probable candidate.

### Possible theories

From this point on, only speculation is possible. Is it possible that Guy IV de Forez decided to go back to France through Bulgaria? At this very moment, Bulgaria was friendly to the crusaders, but taking the land route had very few advantages - the most important of which was the cost and Guy IV was financially ruined.

In any case, if Kondofre was indeed named after Count of Forez, it would likely been far more official than a simple case of the locals paying homage to a great foreign knight and military commander. It was much more likely an official royal charter by the Bulgarian Tzar himself to an important military ally - one that was maybe too sick to continue his journey.

# Conclusion

Although this paper fails to establish a definite link between the name of the village of Kondofrey and the Count of Forez, it definitely establishes him as another very strong potential candidate.

It also clarifies the existing confusion about the numbering scheme for Counts of Forez - and for this there is very compelling evidence.
